<h1>My story</h1>
  Lin Yung Chi <br>
<body>

I like painting, playing games, and walking around outside.
Every time I feel bored or anxious, painting helps me relax. I can focus completely on it, and it takes my mind off everything else. I enjoy choosing colors, trying new ideas, and watching something take shape on the paper. It doesn’t have to be perfect—it just feels good to create something with my own hands.
Like most people, I also enjoy playing games. I don’t usually play multiplayer games because I prefer doing things on my own. I like taking my time, exploring game worlds, and making choices without pressure. It’s a fun way to escape and enjoy some quiet time.
When I need a break from screens or just want some fresh air, I go outside for a walk. I don’t always have a destination—I just like walking around, listening to music or the sounds around me. Sometimes I get new ideas while walking or just feel more at peace.
These hobbies may seem simple, but they help me feel calm, focused, and happy. Whether I’m painting, gaming, or walking, I always feel more like myself after spending time doing what I enjoy.
